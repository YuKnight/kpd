/*
	todo list:

	- next statement 
	- break statement
	- make sure next and break do not
	  cause dead code
	- make sure next/break are in 
	  looping structures?
	- make sure defer runs before
	  return statements.
	- defer is only legal on certain statements
	- size_of only works with expressions so size_of(Type_Node_Path)
	  is not allowed. this should maybe change
	- remove eval blocks since anonymous functions exist
